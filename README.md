# Neural networks architecture cheat-sheet

This repository contains notebooks in which implemented with pytorch neural networks are analyzed and displayed with graphs.
Hoping this helps to understand better the idea behind the network.

- [Resnets](resnets/resnet.ipynb)
- [Wide-ResNets](resnets/wrn.ipynb)

More coming soon ...
